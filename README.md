**Dice Game**

A simple and interactive dice game created as part of a beginner web development course. This project started with template files provided by the course lecturer, but I've made significant modifications to the styling and appearance to make it my own.

**Description**

In this dice game, players can roll two dice and the results are displayed visually on the screen. The goal is to enhance understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while creating an enjoyable user experience.
